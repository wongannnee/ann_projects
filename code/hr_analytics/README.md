# Business Problem: 
With a normal staff turnover rate of 20%, a high volume of recruitment happens monthly and taking 5 collective man-days of a HR recruiter and hiring manager’s time. However, based on records, 33% of selected candidates reject an offer. A study was conducted to identify the critical factors affecting a candidate’s decision, and to predict the possibility of a candidate accepting a job offer 

# Challenges and Solutions:
Consolidation of historical and new data on different formats (word, excel, written) by process re-engineering to collect data in a structured format.  

# Technical Setting:  
•	Technology stack: Python, MS Power BI, Spyder on Anaconda
•	Algorithms: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Gradient Boosting, Logistics Regression, Decision Tree, Gausian Naïve Bayes, AdaBoost, Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbour Classifier, SVM
•	Dataset: Interview scores, job description, candidate demographics, experience and personality profile

# Business Impact:  
10 key factors were found affecting the offer acceptance decision related to job type, compensation and benefit, candidate demographics, personality and workplace rating. Up to 95% predictive accuracy was achieved with MLP.  This assisted the management staff in making job offer decisions, resulting in an acceptance rate of 80% over the last three months.
